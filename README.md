# Crypson

Modern cryptography algorithms using deep learning


```bash
conda activate crypson
```

```bash
cd extern; pip install -e vector-quantize-pytorch
```


### TODO

- [ ] Upload trained checkpoint from server to GitHub
- [x] Verify the test utility for cGAN
- [ ] Implement a quantization mechanism for the cGAN
- [ ] Implement a VQ-VAE
- [ ] Use tensorrt and deploy the two models on a Jetson Nano
- [ ] Create a server-client architecture to encrypt and decrypt files
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Create conda env files
- [ ] Complete `README.md` with instructions and experimental results
- [ ] Post my project report and demo video under `docs` directory
- [ ] Create a GAN `README.md`
- [ ] Create a VQ-VAE `README.md`
