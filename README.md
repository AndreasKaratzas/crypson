# Crypson

Modern cryptography algorithms using deep learning


### TODO

- [ ] Upload trained checkpoint from server to GitHub
- [ ] Verify the test utility for cGAN
- [ ] Implement a quantization mechanism for the cGAN
- [ ] Implement a VQ-VAE
- [ ] Use tensorrt and deploy the two models on a Jetson Nano
- [ ] Create a server-client architecture to encrypt and decrypt files
